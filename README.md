### What I Learned

This project taught me how to create a simple single-page layout for a website that includes animations and links to social media platforms via clickable buttons. I did a small HTML course in a summer camp when I was in 7th grade, but besides that everything was new to me, especially the CSS coding. One thing I found particularly useful was the AI Copilot that we were told to install into Visual Studio Code. Even just the autofill feature is something that is more helpful than I could even imagine, and I'm not even dealing with a lot of code here.

### Problem Solving and Accessibility

The site I created makes it easier for people who are interested in my work to find all of my socials, by putting them in one simply-designed place. Not many accessibility features needed to be created for this page, as it is a very simple site. The accessibility featured on this page consists of alt-text that explains the use of each of the three buttons on the page.

### Fonts, Design, Mockups

The font used for my name on the site is called Junigarden, and I found it on dafont.com. I thought that it perfectly encapsulated the 70's-esque feel that I was trying to go for with the site. To find the beautiful color palette I used, I went to the site "Coolors", which is a website that helps designers find color palettes with all kinds of different contrast types. I used Adobe Illustrator to make a quick mockup for the site using the colors and style that I had selected, and made changes accordingly based on how my coding went.
